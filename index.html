        <p id="bio"> Pat started baking when he was a teen, <br>
            but it wasn’t until he was well into his <br>
            corporate career that he realized baking was <br>
            his true calling. Fed up with the stale <br>
            muffins that seemed to be standard fare at <br>
            all of his board meetings, this baker <br>
            and father of triplets decided to ditch <br>
            software developing and open his own shop <br>
            in 5 different locations world wide called Salmon Cookies.</p>
